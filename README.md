## Move It
This application has a goal of exercising yourself while you are working, to reduce future problems for lack of exercise.


## Technology 

Here are the technologies used in this project.

* Next JS
* Context API
* Web Browser Notification

## Services Used

* Github

## Getting started

First, run the development server:

### npm run dev
# or
### yarn dev

Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying pages/index.js. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

API routes can be accessed on http://localhost:3000/api/hello. This endpoint can be edited in pages/api/hello.js.

The pages/api directory is mapped to /api/*. Files in this directory are treated as API routes instead of React pages.

## Let's see some pages of the project and the features.

### Opening the app, you can see the home page.
